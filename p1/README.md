suggestions about the inputting values:
4<=w<=8
1<=o<=3
12<=g<=15
r should be equal to the sum of o and g
0<p<1 (please set p as small as possible as nobody wants to make a crash)
8<=n<=12

% When running the program, it might be slow because the code is a bit too long. Please be patient to wait for the final answer, thank you.

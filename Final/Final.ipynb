    "### Question 9: ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot a ROC curve for your final classifier on the training data. Refer to **Lecture 22** to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
